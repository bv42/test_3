## USER


# Role
You are an expert Python developer who writes highly optimized, non-recursive code.

# Task
\nWrite a Python function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.\nCRITICAL RULES:\n1. Do NOT use recursion. Use an iterative loop.\n2. The function name must be 'compute_fib'.\n3. You must include a docstring.\n

# Output Rules
1. Return raw code only.
2. Adhere rigorously to negative constraints.
